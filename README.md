# **10 Dogma of Musa**

# 1. Don’t just be sorry, strive to improve.‬
Apologies without action mean little. When you make a mistake, recognize it as an‬
opportunity to learn. Commit to making real changes, and let your actions speak louder‬than your regrets. 
Growth comes from actively seeking to improve every day.‬

# 2. Never settle in comfort, always embrace the struggle.‬
Comfort may feel good, but it’s where dreams stagnate. The struggle is what sharpens‬
‭ your skills, tests your limits, and pushes you toward greatness. Embrace discomfort‬
‭ because that’s where true progress lives.‬
‭
# 3. Progress over perfection.‬
Waiting for perfection only delays your growth. Focus on taking consistent steps forward,‬
‭ no matter how small they seem. It’s the journey of gradual progress that leads to‬
‭ greatness, not the illusion of perfection.‬
‭
# 4. Embrace failure as a stepping stone.‬
Failure isn’t the end; it’s part of the process. Each misstep teaches you something‬
‭ valuable that success alone cannot. Learn to see failure as feedback, and use that‬
‭ knowledge to come back stronger and more prepared.‬
‭
# 5. Nothing is true, everything is permitted.‬
There are no absolute rules holding you back—your limits are defined only by you. This‬
‭ mindset empowers you to break free from constraints, question the norms, and carve‬
‭ your own path. In this world of limitless possibilities, you have the freedom to act boldly‬
‭ and create your own reality.‬
‭
# 6. Strive for excellence, not acceptance.
Don’t live for the approval of others. Set your own high standards and work relentlessly‬
‭ to meet them. Excellence comes from a deep, personal drive to be your best self, not‬
‭ from conforming to what others expect.‬
‭
# 7. Hard times forge resilience.
‭ Challenges are inevitable, but they’re also the moments that define your strength. When‬
‭ you go through tough times, you’re building the resilience needed to face future‬
‭ hardships. It’s the struggle that makes you stronger.‬
‭
# 8. Be relentless in pursuit of your goals.
Success doesn’t come to those who give up easily. Obstacles and setbacks are part of‬
‭ the journey, but persistence is key. Stay focused on your vision, adjust your course when‬
‭ necessary, but never stop moving forward.‬
‭
# 9. Dreams demand sacrifice.
Every big achievement requires something to be given up—whether that’s time, comfort,‬
‭ or resources. Be prepared to work hard, to push through challenges, and to give up‬
‭ short-term pleasures for long-term success.

# 10. Success is built on consistency, not occasional effort.
 Big achievements don’t happen overnight. It’s the small, daily habits and actions that add‬
‭ up over time. Be consistent in your efforts, even when progress seems slow, because‬
‭ that dedication is what leads to lasting success.‬
